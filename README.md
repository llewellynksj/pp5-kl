# InkPad

InkPad is social media platform designed to share, explore and connect with a community of users. The core aim of this web application is to promote and share tattoo designs, and to connect tattoo enthusiasts, artists, and admirers alike.

Users will be able to browse and search through posts. They will be able to create their own posts, and attach tags to these to help others to find certain categories more easily. They will also be able to comment on eachothers posts, and to follow/be followed by other users.

## Design

### **Colour Scheme**

The design of the site was based on an alternative and punky vibe. The site was designed with a dark theme with a black background throughout, utilising a variation of white (#E9ECEF) as the primary font colour. The contrasting bright pink (#FF00DE) was used as a secondary highlighting colour, to make certain things pop.

<br>

### **Typography**

The [Google Fonts]() 'Rubik Distressed' was used for headings. This font is in keeping with the aesthetics of the site.

![Example of Rubik Distressed font on website](readme/images/rubik_distressed.webp)

<br>

For the main content font, 'Moulpali' was used. This is a very simple and easy to read font that was picked with accessibility being the forefront concern. The slightly squared shape of the letters felt more in keeping with the overall design than a more curved, softer, font.

<br>

### **Imagery**

The InkPad logo was created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). The font used in the logo is 'Blanka', and again was chosen due to it's bold, punky style. This font has also been used to create the 'Upload' and 'No results found' images.

### **Wireframes**

[Balsamiq Wireframing Software](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the wireframes.

### **Epics**

### **Kanban Board**

A Kanban approach was used to keep track of the flow of the project. Once User Stories were set up in the Project they were assigned to EPICs and began the project journey in the 'ToDo' column. As development progressed these moved through 'In Progress' to finally 'Done'. An additional column was added 'Unable to implement' for any features that were not successfully completed.

### **Accessibility**

The style of the website has utlised a rough punky style. However, in keeping with best practices steps have still been taken to ensure accessibility is considered throughout.

Close attention has been paid to the following in order to ensure the site is as accessible as possible:

- Contrasting colour scheme.
- Use of semantic HTML.
- Ensuring all images have an alt description for screen readers or where the image cannot be loaded. Also ensuring that these are as descriptive as possible.

<br>

### **Future Features**

In the future there are features and developments that it would be useful to consider adding to create an even better user experience of this website. They include:

- Image cropping on image upload and profile avatar:
